PROJJECCT PROBLEM:

Personal and professional contact management is an essential activity that is apparently still done with pen and paper or on lists in a ms excel file on mobile phones or arduous and tedious manual records that are difficult to update, search and organize. This could imply, for example, that information was lost or duplicated contacts were created or that information was lost or that details were difficult to retrieve or that there was no central storage.
The scope of Contact Book Python Project is to develop a simple, easy to use and powerful software that lets you save, manage, update and access to your contact details easily. user can insert a new contact, he can view all his contacts, he can search a contact, he can update a contact he has or he can delete any contact that he has. This project is good for learning the basics of Python, data structures, CRUD, and modular programming when implemented using Python and file handling or database integration.

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
The scope of this project is limited to the design and implementation of a simple python-based application that can be used to save and manage the contact details effectively. The project consists of the following main areas:
1. Contact Management
Add new contacts, including Name, Phone Number, Email And Address.
2. Store the contact details in a file or database in a structured way.
2. Data Retrieval
Read all stored contacts in a human-readable form.
Find a contact by name or phone number.
3．Data Modification
Modify contact details that already exist.
Delete unwanted contacts.
4. User Interaction
Use a very simple command line / menu driven interface.
Simple to use navigation for users (Clear options to functions).
5. Basic Validation
Check for contacts already existing.
Validate phone number and email (very basic).
6. Storage Mechanism
You can use text file (such as contacts.txt) or JSON for storing the data.
Make sure the contact book keeps its data after the program quit. 


TARGET USERS:
he main intended users are:
1. Students
Those learning Python who want a real project to understand file handling, CRUD operations, and modularized programming.
Students who wish to save contact information of classmates, teachers, or teammates on projects.
2. Individual Users
Those who felt the need for an offline, lightweight contact management system without the "help" of mobile apps and cloud services.
Those who like to keep personal or private contacts on their own computer.
3. Educators and Trainers
We could package it all in egg and deploy it on our servers, and then show the students some basic programming using a real-world, simple, and human project.
Trainers who use it as a model project in Python courses. 
4.Small business owners


HIGH LEVEL FEATURES:
1. Add New Contacts
Enables the users to input new contacts.
Includes such fields as Name, Phone Number Email and Address.
2. View All Contacts
It all makes for a more clean and organized way to display all the contacts users have saved.
Lets you see a quick rundown of your saved data.
3. Search Contacts
Search by name or phone number.
Specific contact details can be retrieved in seconds.
4. Update Existing Contacts
User can update any field of an existing contact.
Keeps your information accurate and current.
5. Delete Contacts
It is the best way to get rid of excess or outdated contacts from the app.
Makes sure your contact list is clean and relevant.
6. Data Storage and Persistence
To keep the contacts permanently, use text file, csv or json.
You still have the data after exiting the program.
7. Basic Data Validation
Disallows duplicate contacts by phone number.
Verifies email and phone number formats (simple rules).
